          Please note that Transformers.js relies on the model first being supported in [ðŸ¤— Transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) and [ðŸ¤— Optimum](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum). If the model you are requesting is not yet supported by either of them, feel free to open up a model request there too.
      options:
        - label: "The model is supported in Transformers (i.e., listed [here](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index#supported-models-and-frameworks))"
        - label: "The model can be exported to ONNX with Optimum (i.e., listed [here](https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum/main/en/exporters/onnx/overview))"

        Please provide additional information about the model here.
        If the model is already supported in Transformers, you can provide example Python code to help ensure the JavaScript implementation (and output) matches the original version.
