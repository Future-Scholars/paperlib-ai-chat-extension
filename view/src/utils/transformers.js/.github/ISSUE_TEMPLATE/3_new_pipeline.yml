          Please note that Transformers.js relies on the pipeline first being supported in [ðŸ¤— Transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers). If the pipeline you are requesting is not yet supported by Transformers, feel free to open up a feature request for it there too.
      options:
        - label: "The pipeline is supported in Transformers (i.e., listed [here](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main_classes/pipelines))"

        Please provide additional information about the pipeline here. If the pipeline is already supported in Transformers, you can provide example Python code to help ensure the JavaScript implementation (and output) matches the original version.
